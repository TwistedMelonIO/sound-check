## Automatic QLab Outcomes

These are sent **automatically by the server** — you do not trigger them manually.

| Trigger | QLab cue armed | Condition |
|---|---|---|
| Any OSC command that enters the Final round | `WIN` armed, `LOOSE` disarmed | `score >= benchmark` |
| Any OSC command that enters the Final round | `LOOSE` armed, `WIN` disarmed | `score < benchmark` |

> The server evaluates the score vs benchmark the moment `/sound-check/round/final`, `/sound-check/round/8`, or `/sound-check/round/one_more_time` is received and immediately arms the correct cue in QLab.
